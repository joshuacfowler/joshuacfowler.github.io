<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>rganisms </p> interact with complex communities of microbes that impact growth and performance. 
I'm interested in scaling these effects up to understand the occurence of species. 
Many species' distributions are made up of smaller populations connected across the landscape by dispersal.
Integrating long-term demographic monitoring data from Archbold Biological Station in central Florida with experimental manipulations of soil microbial communities, I will scale up the effects of soil microbes and variation in microbial communities to their impact on population growth and metapopulation viability of several species of rare and endemic plant species.
In addition to building understanding about the ubiquitous reality in which most organisms live, incorporating important biotic interactions may lead to improved population forecasts that can inform management and conservation. 

range limits are usually explained by climatic and antagonistic biotic interactions that limit 
the ability of species to persist beyond the range edge. Mutualistic interactions have the potential to ease these 
limitations, and this potential has been only rarely examined. Mutualisms are often context-dependent, which makes predicting 
their outcome across different environments challenging. Mutualisms may extend a range limit by improving population 
performance at and beyond the range edge, but these benefits depends on the prevalence of the interaction, the effect
of the interaction, and the sensitivity of the host to the interaction. There are many ways in which mutualisms may be
context-dependent, and range limits are often found along complex environmental gradients.
