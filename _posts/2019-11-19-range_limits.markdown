<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>pecies' range limits are usually explained by climatic and antagonistic biotic interactions that limit the ability of species to persist beyond the range edge. Mutualistic interactions have the potential to ease these limitations, and this potential has been only rarely examined. Mutualisms are often context-dependent, which makes predicting their outcome across different environments challenging. Mutualisms may extend a range limit by improving population performance at and beyond the range edge, but these benefits depends on the prevalence of the interaction, the effect of the interaction, and the sensitivity of the host to the interaction. There are many ways in which mutualisms may be context-dependent, and range limits are often found in along complex environmental gradients. By using demographic field experiments, we can assess the demographic mechanisms by which the mutualism contributes or does not contribute to the range limit. I am generating plant material currently for a seedling transplant experiment with endophyte-infected grasses to quantify how mutualisms contribute to population growth across range limits across three common, Eastern U.S. grasses.</p>
