<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">M</span>utualisms can have context dependent effects on their hosts, conferring benefits during bad years and imposing costs during good years. This context dependence has the potential to reduce the extremely good and the extremely bad years that the host experiences. Symbiotic mutualists may benefit their hosts by buffering demographic variability, even if their effects are neutral on average across years because environmental variability is generally bad for long term population growth. Fungal endophytes are widespread symbionts of grasses that have been shown to provide a variety of context dependent benefits under environmental stress such as drought or salinity tolerance.  In collaboration with [Dr. Jenn Rudgers](https://rudgerswhitneylab.weebly.com/dr-jenn-rudgers.html) we are quantifying the mean and variance effects of symbionts using long-term demographic data from experimental plots in Indiana.
  
We are developing stochastic population models which will allow us to assess the contributions of both the mean and variance components of host fitness. While increasing mean temperature and precipitation are common predictions of climate change, increases in environmental variability are also expected. Understanding the effects of variability is crucial to predicting changes in biotic communities. Variance buffering is a distinct mechanism by which mutualisms can affect natural population which may be particularly important under climate change.</p>
