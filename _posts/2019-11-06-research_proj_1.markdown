<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">M</span>utualisms can have context dependent effects on their hosts, conferring benefits during bad years and imposing costs during good years. This context dependence reduces the extremely good and the extremely bad years that the host experiences. Symbiotic mutualists might benefit their hosts by buffering demographic variability, even if their effects are neutral on average across years because environmental variability is generally bad for long term population growth. Fungal endophytes are widespread symbionts of grasses that have been shown to provide a variety of context dependent benefits under environmental stress such as drought or salinity tolerance.  Using data from a long term demographic field experiment and stochastic population modelling, we are quantifying the effects of symbionts on the mean and variance on host fitness. This work so far has included developing vital rate models and using them to build integral projection models which will allow us to assess the contribution of both the mean and variance components of host fitness. While increasing in mean temperature and precipitation are common predictions of climate change, increases in environmental variability are also expected. This is a broadly underappreciated fact and understanding the effects of variability is crucial to predicting changes in biotic communities.</p>
