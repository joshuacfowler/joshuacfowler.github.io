title:  "Effect of microbial communities on metapopulation dynamics"

<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>rganisms </p> interact with complex communities of microbes that impact growth and performance. 
I'm interested in scaling these effects up to understand the occurence of species. 
Many species' distributions are made up of smaller populations connected across the landscape by dispersal.
Integrating long-term demographic monitoring data from Archbold Biological Station in central Florida with experimental manipulations of soil microbial communities, I will scale up the effects of soil microbes and variation in microbial communities to their impact on population growth and metapopulation viability of several species of rare and endemic plant species.
In addition to building understanding about the ubiquitous microbial reality in which most organisms live, incorporating important biotic interactions may lead to improved population forecasts that can inform management and conservation.
